# street-cv

I live on a street that recieves a bit of traffic during rush hour, and there are countless folk who don't stop at stop signs when they're supposed to.

While normally I would shrug this off, I happen to live **ACROSS THE STREET FROM AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!!**

Most of the highly-egregious offenses occur at the intersection directly across from the school's main entrance.

From Toyota Yurus' to Ford F250's, violators come in all shapes in sizes. I hope that if I gather enough evidence, I can submit a request to the LA Transportation Office to place speed bumps or any other remedy.

# Roadmap
- [X] Use existing models to get object detection working
- [ ] Filter non-vehicles and identify where the intersection sits in frame
- [ ] Program to test whether a vehicle comes to a safe stop
- [ ] Build a waterproof enclosure for a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone REV3 and a USB camera + a solar power source
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Tentative: find a way to upload clips of violators to an S3 bucket from outside my house
- [ ] Find a way to package this repo in order to allow for easy setup by anyone else

If you want to show off a sick car, I love thatâ€”I am a big fan of American Muscle myself. _Just don't speed and blow stop signs by an elementary school_ ðŸ˜
